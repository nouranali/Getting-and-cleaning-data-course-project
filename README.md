# Getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
## The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
## using data set at this link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
## Files:
### README.md 
### CodeBook.md which describes the variables and the data and the operations performed
### run_analysis.R which contains the code used to optimize data in 5 essential steps
## Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
## From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
### FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
